    "## Basepoints Derivations\n",
    "\n",
    "A Lightning node uses a deterministic derivation path based on the [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet standard to derive the following basepoints:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Multisig Keys\n",
    "    * Revocation basepoint\n",
    "    * Payment basepoint\n",
    "    * Delayed payment basepoint\n",
    "    * HTLC basepoint\n",
    "\n",
    "The [BIP43](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0043.mediawiki) \"Purpose\" field defines the first hardened derivation level (m/purpose'/) in hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets to distinguish between different applications. Lightning Network implementations typically use 1017' as the purpose field in their key derivation paths. Although this is not officially standardized by BIP43, it has become a widely accepted convention among implementations such as LND, Core Lightning (c-lightning), and Eclair. This separation ensures that Lightning keys are derived in isolation from other applications, such as on-chain wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key derivation path structure used by LND for Lightning keys is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "m/1017'/coinType'/keyFamily'/0/index\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Components of the Path:\n",
    "\n",
    "* m: The root of the wallet, derived from the master seed.\n",
    "* 1017': The purpose field indicating that the keys are used for the Lightning Network.\n",
    "* coin_type': Specifies the blockchain:\n",
    "    * 0' for Bitcoin mainnet\n",
    "    * 1' for Bitcoin testnet\n",
    "* key_family: Specifies the category of key being derived. Common key families include:\n",
    "    * 1: Revocation basepoints\n",
    "    * 2: HTLC basepoints\n",
    "    * 3: Payment basepoints\n",
    "    * 4: Delayed payment basepoints\n",
    "* key_index: Specifies the index of the specific key within the family.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Per Commitment Points\n",
    "\n",
    "The Per-Commitment Point is a key component of the revocation mechanism in the Lightning Network. It ensures that each commitment transaction is unique and helps prevent cheating during channel closing.\n",
    "- It is a public key derived from a per-commitment secret.\n",
    "- Each channel update generates a new per-commitment point.\n",
    "- The per-commitment point is used to derive the HTLC, delayed and revocation keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "A node must select an unguessable 256-bit seed for each channel and MUST NOT reveal it. This seed is used to derive all per-commitment secrets for that channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to (2^48 - 1) per-commitment secrets can be generated using each seed. The first secret used must have index 281474976710655 (0xFFFFFFFFFFFF), and the index is decremented with each subsequent secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "The I'th secret P must match the output of this algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "generate_from_seed(seed, I):\n",
    "    P = seed\n",
    "    for B in 47 down to 0:\n",
    "        if B set in I:\n",
    "            flip(B) in P\n",
    "            P = SHA256(P)\n",
    "    return P\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficient Storage Strategy\n",
    "The algorithm described above enables an efficient storage strategy. Instead of storing all per-commitment secrets individually, a node stores secrets only at specific indices corresponding to powers of 2 (e.g., 2^X boundaries). From these stored secrets, all intermediate secrets up to the next boundary can be derived when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these \"49 pairs\" strategy, secrets are stored only at powers-of-2 boundaries. Fox example, if we were to create 1,000 secrets for a specific channel, using this strategy we would store only 11 secrets: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,128, 256, 512 and 1024.\n",
    "\n",
    "If each secret is 32 bytes, for 1,000 secrets you have:\n",
    "- Full storage: 1,000 × 32 = 32,000 bytes.\n",
    "- Compact storage: 11 × 32 = 352 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In the example above, we do not use the actual reverse order of indices (as used in practice) to make the explanation easier to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Obscured Commitment Number\n",
    "\n",
    "To help both parties track the commitment number, each commitment transaction encodes its number using the lock time and sequence fields. This encoding is known in the protocol as a state hint. If a party knows the current commitment number, they can use the state hint to quickly identify whether a broadcasted transaction corresponds to a revoked state. To avoid revealing the commitment number directly, an obfuscated state hint is used. This obfuscation is done by XORing the commitment number with 6 random bytes (48 bits) derived deterministically from both participants payment_basepoint. Specifically, the 6 bytes (48 bits) come from the SHA-256 hash of the initiator’s payment_basepoint concatenated with the responder’s payment_basepoint. The obfuscated number is then split across 24 bits of the locktime  and 24 bits of the sequence field, totaling 48 bits for the state hint."
